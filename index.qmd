We are still just talking about tools and features.

And...we are still (mainly) talking with engineers.

## What is a notebook?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Mike Bostock](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/introduction-to-notebooks):\

> "an interactive, editable **document** defined by code. It's a computer program, but one that's designed to be easier to read and write by humans."
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ComputationalNotebook.html):\

> "A computational notebook is an **environment** for writing a prose document that allows the author to embed code which can be easily executed with the results also incorporated into the document."

## Air Quality

@fig-airquality further explores the impact of temperature on ozone level.

```{{r}}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: Temperature and ozone level.
#| warning: false
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess"
)
```
````

## Why make a notebook?

1.  For communicating to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.

2.  For collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!), who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e.¬†the code).

3.  As an environment in which to *do* data science, as a modern day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.

*Suspended reality*

## Principle #1: Suspended reality

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Problem:** Walt Disney found it jarring to see characters out of place. It breaks the suspension of reality.

**Solution:** Disney built the **utilidor** system --- a system of some of the world's largest utility tunnels

*An intricate web of tunnels lies underneath the park, enabling characters to navigate to their respective "worlds" without ever appearing out of world or duplicative.*

3.  [Reuse code chunks in different places](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/reuse-chunks.html)

## Principle #2: Multisensory experience

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Problem:** Being at Disney World needs to be an immersive, memorable experience.

**Solution:** Disney built the **smellitizer** system --- a system that blows air across scented substances to make the air smell a certain (ideally good) way.

## Notebook smells

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Have you ever seen a notebook with...

1.  No meaningful headings (or worse, cute or peppy ones)
2.  No meaningful heading hierarchy
3.  No navigation
4.  No description of the data
5.  No logical order

2.  [Add useful headings](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/organize/add-useful-headings/)

    -   [Use sentence case](https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/grammar-points/capital-letters/#2-use-sentence-case-in-headlines-and-subheads)
3.  Limit to five or six H2 sections max if you can
4.  [Have a topic sentence](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/organize/have-a-topic-sentence/)
5.  Describe your data (5w+1H)
6.  Lay things out in a logical order

## Principle #3: Details matter

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Problem:** When a single detail is wrong, you lose the experience and the magic.

**Solution:** Reduce the chances of losing the magic.

**Examples:**\
\
1. You cannot buy gum

2\. Official no-fly zone

3\. Always within 30 steps of a trash can

1.  Easy styling

2.  Easy layouts
    -   Basic grid with rows/columns
3.  Easy show/hide code and results in output
4.  Easy "run from the top" mode
5.  Easy way to skip or [freeze](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze) a code chunk

## Principle #4: Make it shareable

![](img/sidewalk.jpg){fig-alt="Red concrete sidewalks at Disney World"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Problem:** Making something shareable makes it more memorable.

**Solution:** Make it easier to share.

**Examples:**

*"The concrete---a brainchild of Disney and Kodak---creates more vivid photographs...and also makes the green grass appear greener."*

*"\[Cinderella's\] castle faces south, meaning the sun is never directly behind it. It's (almost) impossible to take a bad photo of yourself in front of Cinderella's Castle."*

3.  Stash bits of code out of sight (with utilidors!)

4.  Annotate easily what to look at and what not to look at üö•

## Summary {background-image="img/wave.jpg" background-size="cover" background-opacity=".25"}

Notebook users should be able to follow all four of these key principles with tools we make for them:

1.  *Suspended reality* --- use utilidors to save their sanity and their code

. . .

2.  *Multisensory experience* --- use navigation and organization to make notebooks smell better to everyone

. . .

3.  *Details matter* --- "Easy things should be easy, and hard things should be possible" (Larry Wall)

. . .

4.  *Make it shareable* --- especially things that don't work and things that aren't done
